# Blargboard Plus
Blargboard Plus is a board software written in PHP and MySQL. It's pretty easy to use, has a good set of features, and is built off of [Blargboard](http://blargboard.kuribo64.net), a board software of the same concept.

To learn more about Blargboard Plus, head over to its [official website](http://bbp.github.io). A stable download of Blargboard Plus is available in [this forum thread](http://www.tierage.net/board/?page=thread&id=5). This repo is for unstable development. Feel free to download this to use for your board, but expect it to explode in your fa- er, have a few issues. Yeah.

## Installation
Upload the files of Blargboard Plus to an FTP server, and that's really it. Make sure to have a MySQL database handy.

Installation is really easy, actually. Just navigation to /install.php on your board, fill out the info, and your done. You're going to need PHP 5.3 at minimum, and MySQL doesn't matter as long s it's recent.

I might nuke this installer in the future, so keep an eye out for that. Why? You should know why if you're familiar with Blargboard's story.

## Plugins and Themes
Blargboard Plus comes with some plugins and themes to get you started. The default theme is Stone, which I personally made myself. You can switch to some classical alternate themes though, as listed below.

### Included Themes
- Stone (Tierage)
- Blarg City (StapleButter)
- Old Cheese (Acmlm)
- Yule XD (Kawa)

I'm sure any other theme for ABXD or Blargboard should work just fine with Blargboard Plus.

### Included Plugins
- Post +1s
- Minimum Post Wordcount
- Custom Username Colors
- IRC Report

Any other ABXD plugin you try to import probably won't work.

## Updating from Blargboard/ABXD/Acmlmboard
The thing is, that doesn't exist. You're not able to update from any other board software at this time with an official tool. Sorry. If you can manage to do it yourself, tell us!
